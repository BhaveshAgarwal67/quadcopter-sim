# Quadcopter Dynamics Simulator (Phase 0)

This project aims to build a quadcopter simulation from first principles using Python.
The focus is on understanding the underlying physics, numerical simulation, and control,
without relying on existing autopilot or robotics frameworks.

## Phase 0: Project Setup & Baseline Modeling (Current)

The current phase establishes the foundation of the simulator.

### Scope
- Project structure and repository setup
- Definition of physical parameters
- Formulation of basic equations of motion
- Initial numerical simulation framework

### Initial Focus
- 1D vertical (altitude) dynamics
- Open-loop simulation using simple numerical integration
- Visualization of state evolution over time

This phase is intentionally minimal and serves as a base for progressively adding
control, estimation, and higher-dimensional dynamics in later phases.
